# BlazorWebRequest Sample Project

Take the blazor _Framework files along with the wwwroot css and place it in the build directory of the basicblazorexamplewebapp project.

**BasicBlazorExample**

This is the blazor wasm client project


**basicblazorexamplewebapp**

This is the backend service that serves the wasm framework file and also routes the rest api requests.

The other project is a shared dependency for both projects to pull from.
